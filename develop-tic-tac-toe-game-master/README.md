#### Context

Alice is the principal of a kindergarten school in Dover, Delaware, U.S.A. 

The young kids in her school are smart and intelligent, and Alice wants them to excel in all fields and decided to run an intensive learning program for them. 

As a part of the program, Alice wants the young kids to be trained in computers. Hence, she has decided to use web games for the kids to help the kids learn computer but in a fun way. 

One of these games is an interactive Tic Tac Toe web game that two kids can play on the same computer. 

The game must have a replay option that plays the kids' recorded moves so that Alice and her staff can later review the moves of the kids and help them learn and grow accordingly. 

#### Problem Statement

Develop a 2-player 3x3 Tic Tac Toe game with a feature of replaying the game.

#### Instructions

1. Download and unzip the boilerplate code.  
2. Run the command `npm install` to install the dependencies required for automated testing.  
3. Open the boilerplate code in VSCode to develop the assignment solution.
4. Provide the solution code within the file `script.js`.
5. Launch the `index.html` page on the browser to view the rendered output.
6. Run the command `npm run lint` to test the code for hygiene checks.
7. Refactor the solution to ensure all test cases are passing.  
8. DO NOT MODIFY THE PROVIDED CODE, ELSE THIS MAY IMPACT THE TEST CODE EXECUTION.
9. Zip the solution code by selecting all the files and folders **excluding the node_modules folder** and give the name same as assignment name to the zipped file.
10. Upload the zipped solution for submission.

## Evaluation Guidelines

1. The solution will be tested based on hygiene checks.
2. The hygiene checks include:
    - Unused variables and functions should not exist.
    - JavaScript naming conventions should be followed for naming identifiers.
    - Length of code lines should not be more than 90 characters.
    - String literals should be provided in double quotes.
    - External dependencies should not be directly referenced, instead should be installed as dependency of dev-dependency.
3. The hygiene checks are tested using ESLint tool.
4. The lint test results generated are stored in `eslint_html_report.html` file and are used to compute the score for grading the submission.
5. The graded score computation is dependent only on `errorCount`, `fatalErrorCount`, `warningCount` values and **Not On** `fixableErrorCount` and `fixableWarningCount` values.
6. These count values have varying weightage and has the following order of precedence (higher to lower): 
    1. FatalErrorCount
    2. ErrorCount
    3. WarningCount
